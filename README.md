# Day of the Week Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements an algorithm in C++ to calculate the day of the
week for a given date without using built-in date or time libraries.

## Objective
- Apply arithmetic-based calendar algorithms
- Strengthen logical and mathematical reasoning
- Avoid reliance on standard date utilities

## Key Concepts
- Modular arithmetic
- Date normalization
- Algorithmic problem solving

## Technology
- C++

## Notes
The implementation prioritizes correctness and clarity of logic rather
than performance or user interface considerations.
