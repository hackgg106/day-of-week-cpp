# Day of the Week Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements an algorithm to calculate the day of the week
for a given date without relying on built-in date or time libraries.

## Objective
- Understand calendar-based algorithms
- Apply arithmetic and logical reasoning
- Avoid dependency on standard date utilities

## Key Concepts
- Modular arithmetic
- Date normalization
- Algorithmic reasoning

## Technologies
- Python / C++

## Notes
The project focuses on correctness and clarity of the algorithm rather
than user interface or performance optimizations.
